# 🎮 Clone-Game

A simple **2D platformer game** built with **Godot Engine 4.5**.  
The game is a learning project where you can move, jump, collect gems, and survive enemy attacks.  


## 🚀 Features
- 🕹️ **Player mechanics**: move, jump, fall, idle, and death animation.  
- 💎 **Gem system**: gems spawn randomly, collectible by the player with sound & animation.  
- 👾 **Enemy AI**: enemy detects and chases the player, plays death animation when defeated.  
- ❤️ **Health system**: player has HP; when it reaches 0, death animation plays and the level restarts.  
- 🔁 **Game loop**: death resets the scene and restores health.  


## 🕹️ Controls
- **Arrow Keys (← →) / A-D** → Move left or right  
- **Space / Enter** → Jump  

## 📷 Gameplay
1. Move around the level.  
2. Collect gems to increase your score.  
3. Avoid or fight enemies — touching them reduces HP.  
4. If HP reaches 0 → player dies, plays death animation, and the scene reloads.
